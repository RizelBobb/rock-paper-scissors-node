# Rock, Paper, Scissors with Node

![rockpaperscissors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22990146/36991494-d134d630-2075-11e8-9933-e922afc91b95.PNG)

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, and Node.js

I served a simple node sever with the http module. Following that, in the HTML, I made a script tag and made three click functions. One click function, declared the variable rock, which would generate random numbers between 0 and 1. If the random number generated was under .3 then, the user would win with the rock input. If not, the user would lose. I did the same thing for all the other choices, except that paper was between .3 and .66, and scissors was between .66 and 1. 
Optimizations
(optional)

This was a for morning challenge in class. If I had more time, I would add a draw option and I would follow the rules for separation of concerns. Also at this time, I did not how to point the node server to a javascript file. 

Lessons Learned:
This was first node server set up. I learned about that, and I learned about quick logic.
